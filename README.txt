This code has been created for the CJ2 project of the University of Applied Sciences Hamburg.

It contains an application created for visually impaired people, with the possibility to navigate 
through it  via voice commands and it utilizes the SpeechRecognizer and TextToSpeech APIs.

The application is still in development, which means that it does not contain all the functionalities
that are needed for a fully functional application for visually impaired people.
